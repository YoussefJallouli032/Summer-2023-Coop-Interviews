        1-To run an application in Angular, you will need to have Node.js and the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) installed on your computer.
        2-Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone this application. 
        3-Run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally: npm install -g @angular/cli
        4-Navigate into the new application directory.
        5-You can now run the development server by using the command : ng serve, 
        6-This will start the development server and open the application in a web browser at http://localhost:4200/
        7- This will create a production-ready build of your application in the dist folder by using the command :ng build --prod
